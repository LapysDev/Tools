<h1> Batch Renamer </h1>
Rename multiple files with more flexibility &amp; formatting options

<h2> How it works </h2>
So here's the scene: You&rsquo;ve got a few couple files that need to be renamed in an order or specific pattern like this: <br/> <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/LapysDev/Batch-Renamer/blob/master/screenshots/files-before.png" title="Primed for renaming ✊🏾"/>

You try to rename using the default Windows File Explorer and... <br/> <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/LapysDev/Batch-Renamer/blob/master/screenshots/files-without.png" title="'Aw, I can't believe you've done this' 😢"/>

"Wait, why are there multiple `regexed (1)`s and a few `regexed (2)`s", you're probably asking and 🤷🏿 <br/>
most likely without looking up some documentation or forums in some more obscure parts of the web you wouldn't know why Windows decided to have a fun trip with a simple list of files

The more intuitive software would however rename the files according to a simple index for starters, that is:
`regexed (1)`, `regexed (2)`, `regexed(3)`, ..., `regexed (n)` and so on 💪🏿

<hr/>

So, that's where the **Batch Renamer** comes in.
It's a simple command-line tool for renaming a set of files in a directory in an ordered rank.
Of course, there are multiple formatting options to allow for more flexibility with the process.

Simply type in a command like this:
```
batch-renamer "--format=regexed (%lu)" precious-files-folder/
```
and voilà, there you go! <br/> <br/>

A proper set of renamed files 👏🏾 <br/> <br/>
